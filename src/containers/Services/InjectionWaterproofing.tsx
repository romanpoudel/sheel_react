                content="Injection is a procedure of pumping cement-based, polyurethane-based, epoxy-based or acrylate-based material into damaged or cracked structures to securely seal leaks, repair compromised structures and make them watertight again for the long term. Injection waterproofing represents a sophisticated approach to combating water infiltration in concrete structures. Unlike traditional methods that rely on surface coatings or membranes, injection waterproofing penetrates the very heart of the structure, addressing vulnerabilities at their source. By injecting specialized waterproofing materials directly into cracks, voids, and porous areas, this technique creates a seamless barrier that fortifies the structure against water penetration, mitigating the risk of leaks, moisture damage, and structural decay."

After that, we drill holes about 4 inches deep on one side of the crack or seam and at an angle, so that when the hole crosses the crack, it does so in the center. For example, on an 8-inch-thick wall, we drill so that the hole intersects 4 inches inside the wall.

As polyurethane mixes with moisture, inside the wall and in the pores of the material, it begins to expand into foam rubber, and the mixed product (polyurethane foam) begins to penetrate into all pores and voids, expand and seal it. The injection should be performed from one end of the injected surface and continue every 5 sm to the other end. As a result, all voids and weak areas will be filled with polyurethane injection composition from groundwater. If we are talking about a crack in the basement, then its upper part is visible from the outside, and with proper injection, you will see that foam rubber oozes out of it, in fact, the seal passes right through it. This is good protection from groundwater.",

If for some reason it is impossible to do this, then it is necessary to perform waterproofing work from the inside.

            <TitleWithContent title="Waterproofing of the foundation by injection method">
                <Paragraph content="Polyurethane injection involves the injection of activated polyurethane resin under pressure through packers hammered into holes drilled in the concrete. The injected resin passes through the entire thickness of the foundation wall or slab (usually 8 inches), expands, and solidifies in the cavity, thereby eliminating cavities and voids, and preventing water from entering your basement. The polyurethane injection waterproofing system is the introduction of a compound into concrete, by drilling and injection under pressure, of a double-component polyurethane resin using specialized equipment, thus filling voids and cavities inside. It is a safe and environmentally friendly solution to stop the penetration of water through foundations, basements, elevator shafts, walls, and concrete joints.
                
                In the ever-evolving landscape of construction and infrastructure, injection waterproofing emerges as a beacon of innovation, offering a formidable defense against water infiltration and structural decay. Through the fusion of advanced materials, precise application techniques, and unwavering commitment to excellence, injection waterproofing stands as a testament to human ingenuity and resilience. As custodians of the built environment, let us embrace the transformative power of injection waterproofing, forging structures that stand as bastions of durability, sustainability, and enduring strength."/>
