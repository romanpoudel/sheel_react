                content="Cementitious waterproofing is a specialized technique that involves the application of cement-based coatings or admixtures to concrete surfaces. This process creates a waterproof barrier, preventing water penetration and safeguarding structures against the damaging effects of moisture, chemicals, and environmental factors. It is the most common method for waterproofing. Its main component is cement, sand, and liquid, some may spend extra to add acrylic addictive membrane to get better bonding and durability. It Is a semi-flexible waterproofing system that uses a mixture of cement and other materials to provide the waterproofing characteristics. It provides a good bonding to the structure to protect against water infiltration to seal against damp soil and seepage. This waterproofing membrane does not stretch since it is made of cement. This membrane usually requires 2-3layer of coating to enhance the waterproofing protection to the concrete surfaces. Cementitious waterproofing membrane is easy to apply with a trowel, brush, roller or even spray method. This method is often used in internal wet areas, it is a rigid, semi flexible type of waterproofing. Since it is commonly used in internal more often, it is not exposed to sunlight and weathering, thus it does not go through contract and expansion process. Cementitious waterproofing is a method used to protect structures from water penetration by applying a cement-based coating or material. It is commonly used in construction to make surfaces such as concrete walls, basements, and foundations impermeable to water."

                <Paragraph content="Cementitious waterproofing works by creating a durable, water-resistant barrier on concrete surfaces, preventing the infiltration of water and protecting structures from the damaging effects of moisture. The process involves the use of cement-based coatings or admixtures, which work in various ways to enhance the waterproofing properties of the concrete. The process of cementitious waterproofing involves the application of a cement-based mixture that forms a waterproof barrier when cured. This mixture is often composed of Portland cement, sand, and chemical additives that enhance its waterproofing properties. The application can be done using brushes, trowels, or sprayers." />
