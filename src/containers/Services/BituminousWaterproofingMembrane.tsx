                involves the application of a bitumen-based substance to surfaces for protection against water
                intrusion. Bitumen, a viscous and waterproof material derived from crude oil, serves as the primary
                component in these coatings. Bituminous coatings are widely used in various construction applications to
                provide effective waterproofing. Here's an overview of bituminous coating waterproofing:"

                    content="First of all, bitumen has an economic process. Bitumen, which
                    remains after crude oil distillation process, is a by-product When primary products such as petrol, diesel,
                    high octane fuels and gasoline are refined, the bitumen is left behind.
                    <br> <br> Besides, bitumen is a versatility product. It shows viscoelastic and thermoplastic behaviors.
                    Bitumen has both viscous and elastic behaviors depending on the temperature and loading time. At high-
                    temperature or in long loading times, bitumen behaves as a viscous material. At low temperatures or in fast
                    loading mode bitumen behaves like an elastic solid.
                    <br> <br> The melting point of the bitumen is not so high that it can be melted easily during the
                    application. The bitumen has a highly adhesive nature, which keeps the materials together strongly. All
                    these features prove that bitumen waterproofing is one of the most convenient solutions up to usage areas."
